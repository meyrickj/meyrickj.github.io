## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/joe-london.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My Name is Joe Meyrick.  I am currently a Senior IT Support Specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business.  I have been in tech for the last 7 years and always trying to better expand my knowledge.  I love trying to provide automation for anything and everything I can.

I am also an avid traveler trying to see the world one city at a time!
