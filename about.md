## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/joe-london.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My Name is Joe Meyrick.  I am currently a Senior IT Support Specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business.  I have been in tech for the last 7 years and always trying to better expand my knowledge.  I love trying to provide automation for anything and everything I can.

<br> 
I've recently begun getting in to smart home automation which brought me down a path to lear more about what Alexa can do.  To better understand the underlying arcitecture I decided to develop my own Alexa skill to know how Amazon Web Serivces works, the Alexa skill kit and to teach myself how python can be used in conjunction with all of these services.  The process of creating this skill has been very enjoyable and has strengthened my python programming abilities. 

<br> 
In my spare time I am also an avid traveler trying to see the world one city at a time!
